The `if` statement above tests to see if the `boolean` value of "rain" is true. If it is, the "true branch" statement is executed. If not, the "false branch" statement is executed. Notice how we separate the "true branch" and the "false branch" by the reserved word `else`. The expression that goes inside the `if` statement must evaluate to true or false for the statement to execute, and anything that evaluates to a `boolean` value can be placed inside brackets.

"If you're tired, go to sleep. Otherwise, stay awake."

"If you're hungry, eat. Otherwise, don't eat."

The `if` statement allows the programmer to structure results using the same logic we use in our everyday lives.
