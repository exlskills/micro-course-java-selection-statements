Let's start exploring the structure of an `if` statement in Java by relating it to a real life scenario. Suppose you are walking down the street with an umbrella. We ask one question in order to get a true or false response: "is it raining?". If we answer yes, or "true", then one course of action takes places, we open and use the umbrella. If the answer is no, or "false", another course of action takes place, the umbrella stays closed. This is the basis for an `if` statement in Java; one of two different courses of action take place based on a "true" or "false" answer. These types of statements involve a binary (two-way) decision. Play with the example below, which uses our umbrella scenario, by changing the `boolean` "rain" to "false".
