Each `else if` statement has its own expression that returns true or false. Only the FIRST expression that evaluates to "true" is executed. As we see above, if the expression `exampleVariableOne &lt; 10` returns a value of "true", only the statements within the curly brackets of the `if` statement are executed, and all the statements that follow are ignored. If none of the expressions evaluate to "true", the statement inside the curly braces of the `else` statement are executed. Remember these vital rules when working with `if` statements:

1. The `if` statement may contain zero or one `else` statement that must come after any `else if` expressions.
2. The `if` statement may have zero or more `else if` expressions that must come before the `else` statement.
3. Once the expression in an `else if` statement evaluates to true, all the remaining `else if` and `else` expressions are ignored.
