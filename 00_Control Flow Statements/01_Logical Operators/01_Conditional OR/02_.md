The "OR" operator only checks to see if one the `boolean` values are true. Here are the possibilities and the results for each case.

1. true \|\| true = true
2. true \|\| false = true
3. false \|\| true = true
4. false \|\| false = false

The "OR" operator functions similarly to how the word "or" is used in English. If one of the options you mention when using "or" is met, the other one doesn't matter. For example, if you are looking for a muffin or a donut, your needs are satisfied when you find a muffin, a donut, or both.
