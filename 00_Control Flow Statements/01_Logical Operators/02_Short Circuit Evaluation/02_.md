The code above shows an example of short-circuit evaluation. Did you wonder why "5/0" did not cause an error when you ran the program? This is because "5/0" was not evaluated and ignored by the program. When working with the "OR" operator, if the first operand evaluates to "true", no matter what the second operand evaluates to, the result will always be "true". The program therefore doesn't even look at the second operand if the first operand evaluates to "true".

Similarly, when using the "AND" operator, if the first operand evaluates to "false", no matter what the second operand evaluates to, the result will always be "false", so the second operand is ignored.
