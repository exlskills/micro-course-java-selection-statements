Some of the more common iterations for De Morgan's Law:

1. !(A && B) is the same as !A \|\| !B
2. !(A \|\| B) is the same as !A && !B
3. !(C > D) is the same as C <= D
4. !(C < D) is the same as C >= D
5. !(C >= D) is the same as C < D
6. !(C <= D) is the same as C > D
7. !(E == F) is the same as E != F
8. !(E != F) is the same as E == F

Remember, you do not have to limit yourself to two operands when you work with the "AND" operator and the "OR" operator. `!(A && B && C)` is the same as `!A||!B||!C`. For the iterations shown above, A and B have to be `boolean` values, C and D have to be numbers and E and F may be a variety of data types.
