Only the expressions with `true` on both sides of the "AND" evaluate as `true`. Here are the different possibilities and their outcomes:

1. true && true = true
2. false && true = false
3. true && false = false
4. false && false = false

The AND operator evaluates both operands, the expressions on each side, before determining the final value. This is useful when you want two or more expression to be true before executing a statement. Using them in an `if` statement will simplify your code structure and reduce your time spent on coding.
